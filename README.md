##Use useReducer and useContext to enable dark mode functionality for users visiting


###use context inplemented at a basic level for understanding, use reducer will be the same for a simple login

Dark Mode context is where I'll be playing with use context. A bit more tedius as it is in typescript.

//why not create the state for holding dark mode in DarkModeContext? Atomising this functionality.
//Instead of having it on the layout (template) level, have this on the organism level [Also need to put layout into a template folder]
